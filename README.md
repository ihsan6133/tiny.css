# Tiny.css

A very tiny css library to quickly build a webpage.

## Why?

The default styles in modern browsers look absolutely displeasing. I find myself wanting to create
a quick html page, only to spend thirty minutes setting up the basic styles. Tiny.css provides basic
but good looking styles for a webpage.

## Installation

Just stick this in the `<head>` tag of your html file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tiny.css@0">
```

and that's it!

**Note:** Currently only light theme is supported.
